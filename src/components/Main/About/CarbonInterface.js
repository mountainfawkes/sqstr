      Carbon Interface makes it easy for developers to perform carbon emissions calculations through an easy-to-use API. In order to provide accurate estimates that developers can trust, each estimate type has a different carbon calculation that factors in best practices from <a href='https://ghgprotocol.org/'>GHG Protocol</a>, the <a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/'>IPCC</a> and country-specific agencies such as the <a href='https://www.epa.gov/'>EPA</a>. Additionally, all emissions data is versioned to ensure accurate estimates in the future and audit purposes. We believe in being transparent with our calculations and data sources so developers can assure their users that they are performing accurate emission estimates.
