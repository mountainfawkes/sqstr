    <p>
      Right now, there is an emerging market for carbon-based cryptocurrency and an urgent climate crisis. While the emphasis of solutions should be placed on collective action by our largest institutions (ahem, corporations), there does not currently exist a consumer-level service that can estimate individual carbon emissions and recommend direct action in the form of carbon-based token investments. Sqstr will change that by providing an engine that recommends the amount of carbon tokens an individual should buy based on their individual level of carbon emissions. This tool will gather user input required to query an API that responds with a carbon estimate in tonnes backed by a science-based and peer-reviewed methodology. This figure will be cross-referenced with another API that responds with the current value of the UPCO2 carbon-based token (currently hovering around $9.50 per tonne).
