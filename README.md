### About sqstr

<br />

Right now, there is an emerging market for carbon-based cryptocurrency and an urgent climate crisis. While the emphasis of solutions should be placed on collective action that includes our largest institutions, there does not currently exist a consumer-level service that can estimate individual carbon emissions and recommend direct action in the form of a carbon-based token investment.

sqstr will change that by providing an engine that recommends the amount of carbon tokens an individual should buy based on the carbon-emitting activities they engage in&mdash;flights, drives, consumed electricity, and a handful of other carbon-intensive activities.

This tool gathers user input required to formulate a carbon emissions estimate in tonnes backed by a science-based and peer-reviewed methodology. This figure is cross-referenced with the current value of the [UPCO2 carbon-based token](https://universalcarbon.com/) to provide a recommended investment to partly or wholly offset individual carbon emissions.

## Technologies Used

<br />

- React
- VS Code

<br />

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

<br />

- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<br />

### Installation

<br />

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/mountainfawkes/sqstr`.
2. Navigate to the `/sqstr` directory
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base

<br />

- #### **Run the Program**

<br />

1. Nagivate to project folder using `cd /sqstr`
2. `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. `npm start` to run application server
4. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your preferred browser

<br />

### Known Bugs

<br />

* Dependency conflicts have dogged this project since its inception; these may only materialize locally on systems with dependency conflicts higher up in the dependency tree. If necessary, navigate to your root directory to explore the global `node_modules` in the event that dependency conflicts arise. Babel and React Scripts were especially problematic in sqstr's development environment.

## **Acknowledgements**

<br />

This project was developed alongside the [LearnHowToProgram curriculum](learnhowtoprogram.com) at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp in Portland, Oregon.

This app would not have been possible without the amazing cohort I studied with at Epicodus. A special thanks goes to [Erik Irgens](https://github.com/erik-t-irgens) and [James Henager](https://github.com/jhenager), whose consistent presence and demos of state and classic RPG victory jingles have been instrumental in keeping the torrid pace of Epicodus managable.
